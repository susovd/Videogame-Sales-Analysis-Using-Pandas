## Background

Heroes of Pymoli

![Fantasy](Images/Fantasy.png)

In this project, I analysed the data from a video game company for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. First, I generated a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights using Pandas and Jupyter notebook.

The final report includes each of the following:

### Player Count

* Total Number of Players

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)

* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics

* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

* The below each broken by gender
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

### Age Demographics

* The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. 6-10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

### Top Spenders

* Identified the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * SN
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value

### Most Popular Items

* Identified the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):
  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  * Purchase Count
  * Item Price
  * Total Purchase Value

### Most Profitable Items

* Identified the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  * Purchase Count
  * Item Price
  * Total Purchase Value

### Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/about/)
  * [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/index.html)
  


## Results
Based on my analysis, I observed following trends.

1. Most of the players are overwhelmingly males. About 84% of players are males.

2. Players in the age group 20-24 years comprise the biggest population of the gamers. Targeting them might yield better results for gaming companies.

3. Gender has little effect on average purchase per person. Therefore, it would be better to target gamers based on age instead of sex of the gamers.
